<chapter id="_introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Collaborative Project Developer is a very simple tool which enable us to collaborate on a project and maintain version.
In a project it is very important to maintain versions and commit history, but the VCS which are available requires getting used to it. So, we started developing <literal>Collaborative Project Developer</literal>, which is very simple to use even for the first timer.</simpara>
<section id="_motivation">
<title>Motivation</title>
<simpara>We wanted to develop an application, which can help people start collaborating on project development without having to go learn all the technicalities of version control systems such as git and perforce.
So, we started working on this simple versioning and collaborative tool.</simpara>

<section id="_algorithm">
<title>Algorithm</title>
<simpara>In transaction processing, databases, and computer networking, the two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is a type of atomic commitment protocol (ACP). It is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction (it is a specialized type of consensus protocol). The protocol achieves its goal even in many cases of temporary system failure (involving either process, network node, communication, etc. failures).</simpara>

<section id="_platform">
<title>Platform</title>
<simpara>We are using node.js as our platform for developing this project. Alongwith node.js we are using some libraries to make development process faster.</simpara>
<section id="_node_js">
<title>Node.js</title>
<simpara>Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome&#8217;s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
.An Example of node.js server</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var http = require('http');

//Lets define a port we want to listen to
const PORT=8080;

//We need a function which handles requests and send response
function handleRequest(request, response){
    response.end('It Works!! Path Hit: ' + request.url);
}

//Create a server
var server = http.createServer(handleRequest);

//Lets start our server
server.listen(PORT, function(){
    //Callback triggered when server is successfully listening. Hurray!
    console.log("Server listening on: http://localhost:%s", PORT);
});</programlisting>

<title>Express</title>
<simpara>Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.[1] It is the de facto standard server framework for node.js.[2] The original author, TJ Holowaychuck, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,[3] meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins.</simpara>

<section id="_mongoose">
<title>Mongoose</title>
<simpara>Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.</simpara>

<title>Passport</title>
<simpara>Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.</simpara>

<section id="_codemirror">
<title>Codemirror</title>
<simpara>Codemirror is an open source library used for implementing code editor in web pages.
We have used this plug-in for implementing the code editor that is displayed on our web-app.</simpara>

<chapter id="_structure_of_the_app">
<title>Structure of the App</title>
<simpara>The structure of our app is inspired from MVC design philosophy.
In MVC(Model View Controller), we separate what we have to show(views) from the main logic(controller). Similarly we also separate the models of underlying structure(models).</simpara>
<simpara>In our main app, we have the following directories/files.</simpara>
<section id="_views">
<title>Views</title>
<simpara>In this directory, we write all the files that we have to display. For example, <literal>index.html</literal>, <literal>login.html</literal> and <literal>signup.html</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_routes">
<title>Routes</title>
<simpara>In this directory, we write all the server routes.
For example, to handle the request for approving the code by a particular team member, we wrote the following code in <literal>index.js</literal> in routes directory:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">router.get('/accept/:id', function(req, res, next) {
  Code.findOne({_id: req.param("id")},function(err, doc){
    var idxt = doc.approval.indexOf(req.user.local.email);
    if(doc.approval[idxt] != req.user.local.email){
      doc.approval.push(req.user.local.email);
      console.log("index in approval is"+idxt);
    }
    var idx = doc.rejection.indexOf(req.user.local.email);
    if(doc.rejection[idx]==req.user.local.email){
      doc.rejection.splice(idx, 1);
      console.log("index in rejection is"+idx);
    }
    res.send("OK");
    console.log("Updated Approval and Rejection List are:");
    console.log(doc.approval);
    console.log(doc.rejection);
    updateCommit(doc);
    console.log(doc.committed);
    doc.save();
  });
});</programlisting>
